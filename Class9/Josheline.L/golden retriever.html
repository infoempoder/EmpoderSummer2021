   <h2> Golden retrievers breeds: </h2> 

   <p> "While you might think all Golden Retrievers look very similar, the breed actually has three different colors -- golden, light golden, and dark golden -- as well as three different types -- English, Canadian, and American. There are subtle differences between the types of Goldens, but they all fall under the same breed." These resource is found in "6 fun facts that you probubly don't know about Golden retrievers". Basekly there are three golden retriever breeeds from different types as explaned in the source.</p>

<h2> Normal temperture for Golden retrievers: </h2> 

   <p> "The normal body temperature for dogs is between 101 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes, Golden Retrievers can live in hot temperatures but they're vulnerable to it. The ideal temperature for a Golden range between 60°F to 80°F and temperatures in the 90s°F and 100s°F puts them in risks of dehydration, overheating, and sunburns." </p> 

  <h2> How can Golden retrievers get sick: </h2> 

  <p> "Golden Retrievers are susceptible to bacterial and viral infections — the same ones that all dogs can get — such as parvo, rabies, and distemper. Many of these infections are preventable through vaccination, which we will recommend based on the diseases we see in our area, her age, and other factors."These sorce is found in animal center. Over all they can get sick by cold tempertauresa and need to be treated well.  </p>

  <h2> Routine for properly caring for Golden retrievers:  </h2> 
      
        <ul>
          <li> Exercise: "Most healthy adult Golden Retrievers will need at least 90 minutes of high-quality exercise every day."  </li>
          <li> Nutrition: "The best diet for Golden Retrievers is a high-quality protein-rich diet consisting of 18-22% protein. Dogs can also get nutrients from vegetables, fruits, and grains. However, they should have the right amount of protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber for optimum health and lifespan."</li>
          <li> Living space: Golden retrievers don't need thaqt much space like other dogs but do need a pretty decent room to move around and get enough of their extercise. </li>

    <h2> Causes of Illness: </h2> 
      
        <ul>
          <li> Cancer:"Gene pools on both continents are large, so breeding between the two populations is rare. When studied in the lab, genomic differences suggest that risk for some types of cancer is related to recent genetic mutations in North American Golden Retrievers." </li>
          <li> hypothyroidism : "Insufficient blood levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), due to disease of the thyroid glands, affects up to 25% of Golden retrievers. The cause is unclear, but is thought, at least partly, to have a genetic basis." </li>
          <li> Skin problems: "Atopic dermatitis is a heritable condition that some Golden Retrievers develop as an inflammatory reaction to things like tree pollens, grasses, ragweeds, dust, mold and insects such as fleas, ticks and mosquitoes. Food intolerances can also cause skin allergies and gastrointestinal disorders in Golden Retrievers." </li>
          <li> All of these info can be found in "Golden retrievers with skin allergies", "Golden retriever-hypothyroidism", and "Large-Scale Cancer Study of Golden Retrievers Holds Hope" websites. </li>
