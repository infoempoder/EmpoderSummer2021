            Yoga:
          </b>
           Yoga is also a great way to take your mind off things and if you just do a few minutes a day you can do much more things because you will pay more attention to what your doing and won't get distracted as much which if you have an assingment due you won't stress for turning it late or having nothing done when it's close due. </li>

          <b>
            Make time for yourself
          </b>
           Which is different from taking a break, a break is something short you do on the spot but making time for yourself is when you stop doing what you are doing and do something you love for a long time like hanging out with friends going to visit family stuff like that. </li>
