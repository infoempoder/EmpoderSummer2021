<h3> How does water pollution affect the environment: </h3>
<p> Water pollution can bring a big effect on the environment, when the water in the ocean gets polluted there wont be enough oxygen in the water for the animals to breath. This is a big problem because animals like fish can die. Sometimes the water pollution can affect the whole food chain. For instance the small fishes absorbe all those pollutants in the water. They can absorbe the chemicals into their bodies. When the big fish eat the small fish the absorbe the pollutants from thr bodie of the small fish. Sewage is also anothe big problem in the river because the bacteria in the water uses oxygen to brakedown the sewage. If theres to much sewage the bacteria is going to use so much oxygen, there wont be any left for the animas in the water. The water pollution from important events like acid rains or oil spills can destroy completly all the marine habitats.  </p>
