<h3> How does air pollution affect the environment: </h3>
<p> Just like humans, animals, and plants the entire ecosystem can suffer consequences from air pollution. Air pollution can directly pollute the surface of bodies of water and soil. This can kill the agricultural produce or reduce their yield. It can also kill young trees and many other plants. Sulf dioxide and nitrogen oxide are particales that are in the air and can make precipitation with high levels of nitric and sulfuric acids when they mix in water and oxygen in the atmosphere. These air pollutants for the most part come from a power plant that makes electricity by burning coal and motor vehicles. When acid rain falls to earth, it harms the plant by changing the soil composition, reducing the water quality in rivers, lakes and streams, it also damages crops and can cause buildings and monuments to decompose. </p>
