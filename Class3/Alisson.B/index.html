<h3> Why is the environment important: </h3>
<p> Our environment is important to the world because it help the ecosystem expand and improve in many different ways.When we don't protect the environment we put so many creatures and human beings in endangerment for instance plants, animals, crops and even human kind.One important reason that the enviroment is important to keep safe is that it helps human kind. Imagine not having an enviroment in your community we would'int even have a place to stay in or resources to use like food that comes from plants.Even our air, water and food are in danger because of the enviroment pollution.The forest is another important part of the enviroment, all around the forest theres things that keep us alive.The forest allows us to have timber, wood, rubber and essential oil.</p>
