    Knowing some Minecraft facts is helpful in some cases. For example, did you know that on Bedrock edition, you can  make an infinite potion. To do this, put the potion you want in a cauldron, then you put water above the place the dripstone is gonna be, last thing you do is place the blocks that block the water off and place the dripstone above the cauldron.
