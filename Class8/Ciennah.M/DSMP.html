  <h1> The Wonderful World of the Dream SMP. </h1>

  <h2> Ahh yes, the dream smp. There is so many things to do! You can build a home, marry, murder. Such a perfect SMP am I right? </h2>

  <div class= "columnF"> 
    <p> The Dream SMP was created as a survival world created by GeorgeNotFound and Dream. Since then, they’ve added more people to the server, racking up 33 official members along with surprise visits from others. On this server, there is content that some creators do call Lore. The lore on the SMP is a variation of storytelling that is performed every so often during an event on the SMP. There have been wars, time traveling, memory loss, and lots of deep emotions that can come from the lore that contributes to the overall storyline of the SMP.

        <h3> <mark> Disc Saga </mark> </h3>
        <p>  The first war we come across is the Disc War. The Disc War was between Dream and TommyInnit. The two discs are Tommy’s prized possessions on the server. Dream however wanted to get a hold of them, so he could have complete control over Tommy. They have been going back and forth, using the discs as leverage over one another all until January 21st of 2021 where Tommy and Tubbo fought Dream to the death. Dream ended up losing 2 of his 3 cannon lives that day and was placed in Pandora’s Vault, a prison built on the server by Awesamdude. Dream would have lost all three of his cannon lives that day, but the only thing that kept Tommy from taking all of them was the fact that Dream could revive people after they had lost their third cannon life. So, with Wilbur dead and hopes to bring him back to life, they just locked up Dream for later use. Dream was locked up AFTER all/most of the conflict below. Just wanted to mention that to avoid confusion that Dream got out of the prison, which didn't happen yet.</p>

    <h3><mark> L'manburg War</mark> </h3>
    <p>  The L'amanburg War is the server's second ongoing conflict. WilburSoot had decided to start a nation called L'amanburg after he joined the server. Tommy, Fundy, Tubbo, Eret, and Fundy were the members of this nation. Wilbur and Tommy declared their nation's independence, which sparked the war. This was not something Dream had wished for as Because he would no longer be in charge of those individuals. But things didn't look good for L'amanburg when Eret betrayed them and left them in the dust. There was nothing else Tommy could do at this point, and nothing L'amanburg could do, so he challenged Dream to a duel. L'amanburg would gain its independence if Tommy won. Dream, on the other hand, would receive one of Tommy's discs if he won. Even though Tommy lost the war, it wasn't quite finished. Tommy struck a new bargain with Dream, promising to hand up both of his discs in exchange for L'amanburg's freedom. L'amanburg was born after the successful deal.</p>

      <h3> <mark> The Manberg Rebellion </mark> </h3>
      <p> Wilbur, President of L’amanburg, decided to hold an election since there was no vote giving him his leadership. Four parties were then created. Pog2020 with Wilbur and Tommy, Swag2020 with Quackity and GeorgeNotFound, Coconut2020 with Niki and Fundy, and Schlatt2020 with JSchlatt running solo. A vote was held on Twitter to have viewers determine the outcome. Pog2020 ended up having the most votes, but before the election started, Quackity made a deal with Schlatt saying that if neither of them were the victors, they would combine their votes. As a result, both parties combined votes so that JSchlatt was voted the new President of L’amanburg, with Quackity as his Vice President. Immediately JSchlatt made his first decree to revoke the citizenship of WilburSoot and TommyInnit. </p>

        <h3> <mark> Manberg vs. Pogtopia </mark> </h3>
        <p>Manberg vs Pogtopia is arguably one of the best wars and the biggest war to have ever happened on the server. This war took place on November 16, 2020. There was a lot of preparation going into this war as Wilbur, Tommy, Tubbo, Technoblade, Fundy, and Nihachu built an underground city known as Pogtopia. With help from Technoblade they received some of the best gear on the server that prepared them for war. Along the way they recruited other members to fight against JSchaltt and his new found nation, Manberg. Schlatt received help from Dream along with some others to fight back, until Dream gave up the location of Schaltt where he was hiding. As Tommy was about to take Jschlatt’s last cannon life, he died from a stroke. But, it wasn’t over just yet. Wilbur and Tommy could regain their spots as President and Vice President, but they ended up giving leadership over to Tubbo with Tommy as his Vice. However, this entire time Dream had warned them that there was a traitor among the members Pogtopia. When Schlatt died he admitted to this being a lie, but he was in fact not telling the truth. Wilbur was the traitor. He had been having thoughts of blowing L’amanburg up for the longest time and it had happened on that date. He was caught right before pushing the button by Philza, but after the deed was done, he requested to die, and Wilbur had lost his final canon life. Yet again, it wasn’t over just then. Technoblade, being an anarchist, did not like the idea of rulers or any higher power. When Tubbo became their new leader and felt betrayed since he had helped them regain L’amanburg from Schlatt. So, he unleashed multiple withers, and once they were defeated, he had become an enemy of the state of the New L’amanburg.  </p>

          <h3> <mark> The Doomsday War  </mark> </h3>
          
          <p> This war by far was one of the most devastating. Dream, Technoblade, and Philza went against all the members of L’amanburg. The war was supposed to take place at 3:00 P.M., but they attacked earlier and unexpectedly from above, raining thousands upon thousands of explosives on the nation, and unloading a total of 15 withers. L’amanburg was not prepared for this and was destroyed, leaving behind a huge crater of all the history left behind.</p>

         <h3> <mark> Exile Arc </mark> </h3>
        The Exile Arc kicked off when a new member of the server, Ranboo, joined. Ranboo had been goofing around with Tommy and both decided to burn down and grief George’s house. Dream being George’s very close friend was not happy with this at all, and with Tubbo being the new leader of L’amanburg he had demanded that something be done. Over the course of a couple days Dream was like a gnat in Tubbo’s ear trying to get him to betray Tommy. This eventually did happen when Tubbo exiled Tommy from L’amanburg, and he couldn’t walk on any of the grounds of the SMP that had already been discovered. Dream took Tommy far away and would visit him every week, making sure he stayed put. Tommy’s lore from they’re got pretty dark diving into topics that were pretty serious. Eventually he started to wake and realize that he could just run away while Dream was gone. So, he did just that. On his journey away from exile, he discovered a house in one of the snow biomes of the server. This ended up being Technoblade’s house. From here Techno would provide for Tommy until one day he returned to L’amanburg to confront Tubbo. In their altercation Tubbo gave Dream one of Tommy’s discs. Somehow Tommy also ended up turning on Technoblade and becoming friends with Tubbo once more. This is what kicked off the Doomsday War.

        <h3> <mark> The Imprisonment </mark> </h3> 
        <p> The Arc ties a lot into the Disc War. Towards the end of the Disc War, Dream was put in Pandora’s Vault for later use, claiming he could revive the dead. Since then Dream has been in this prison with no way of escaping. The prison system, run by Awesamdude, was thought to be very safe and inescapable. Overtime people have visited Dream including Tommy, Sapnap, BadBodyHalo, and Ranboo. One day Tommy vowed that this would be his last time visiting Dream. Everything was going smooth until unexpected explosions were heard right outside of the prison. With security being so tight and strict in Pandora’s Vault, Tommy would have to remain in prison with Dream until the security situation was resolved. The situation was in fact not resolved for over two weeks. Tommy had been annoying Dream constantly with their time together. One day Dream snapped and killed Tommy taking his last cannon life. Tommy’s next stream we see a pitch black screen, and Tommy is heard talking to Wilbur in the afterlife. Wilbur’s voice all of a sudden gets very faint, to the point of where it vanishes. Tommy’s screen then flashed back to him inside the prison with Dream. Tommy had been brought back to life. With this Tommy was able to escape the cell notifying Sam. Viewers were able to learn that Dream actually had the power to bring people back to life and we are left to wonder what he will do with it. </p>
