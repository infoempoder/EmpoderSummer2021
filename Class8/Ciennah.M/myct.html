          <ul>
    <li> Emilepsi = Emilepsi, or other known as Emi / Emily is a small streamer on twitch. She mainly streams Minecraft bedwars or survival worlds. She recently did IRL stream at an aquarium. She is such a kind person one of my favorite streamers. </li> 
    </br>
    <li> Bonkprovider = Bonkprovider, or other known as Bonk is also a twitch streamer but they are a bit more complexe. They stream minecraft mainly, and sometimes collabs with Emilepsi. Bonk also collabs with other streamsers like PodcastWithoutAPurpose and awatch and play things on that channel. He lives in the UK so he is extra special. </li>

    <li> Tommyinnit = Tommyinnit, or other known as Tommy / Tom, is a minecraft streamers that also posts on youtube doing IRL videos. Many people find him very annoying at first, but after a while if you still do not find him annoying he is funny and nice, in his own way. He got a bit addicted and now I have his laugh, which is really weird.  </li>
    <br>
    <li> Ranboo = Ranboo, jokingly known as Mark by Tommy and Tubbo. He streams Minecraft and often appears in Tommyinnits youtube videos. He is on the DSMP and has a really cool character. His character is half enderman and half something else. Some people think that his other half is a Farlander Enderman. He is funny in his own style, and is 6'6. </li>
