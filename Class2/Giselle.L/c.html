   <p> Onya-Birri the albino koala was born to two perfectly normal, gray koalas at the San Diego Zoo in 1997. His name comes from an Aboriginal (indigenous Australian) phrase meaning “ghost boy” after his white fur. Since he is a marsupial, Onya-Birri spent his first six months in his mother’s pouch. When Onya-Birri popped his face out of mom’s pouch, the zoo staff were surprised by his white fur and pink nose. Albino koalas, like most albinos, are very rare, but they have been found in the wild before. Once out of the pouch, this little ghost boy had to learn how to live life as both a koala and an albino.

    <p> Koalas are a type of mammal called marsupials, which give birth to underdeveloped young. They are so different from any other marsupial, however, that they have been classified into their own family, called Phascolarctidae. </p>

<p> A whole herd of white deer lives at the Seneca Army Depot in New York. These white-tailed deer were trapped within the fence of the depot when it was built and as the years went on, they bred and their population grew. However, these deer aren’t true albinos, because they still have pigment in their eyes. Albinos don’t produce melanin at all, which is the pigment that gives color to skin, eyes, hair, scales, and feathers. Albino eyes are either pink, light blue, or green because the red blood vessels are showing through or because of how light passes into the iris. </p>
