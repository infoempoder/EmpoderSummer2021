<h3>The Feminization of Teaching</h3>    
<img src ="women22.jpeg" height =70%; width =70% class="center_image topPadding">
<p>The Suffrage Movement established equality between men and women and allowed women to take up the position of teaching. This influenced our profession's history because women are able to take on the role of teaching without discrimmination or being looked down upon.</p>

<h2>Reforms in a New Nation</h2>
<p>Social reforms for women in education can be traced from the 17th and early 18th centuries
when arguments for reform in women’s education were first launched in the aftermath of
Revolutionary War. Most of this support concerned the need for women’s basic education while
attempts to secure education for women in high schools or in universities were less audible.
Demands for equal educational opportunities for women, in general, were quite revolutionary for
the new nation and greatly challenged the status of women’s existing place in the domestic
sphere. </p>

<h2>The Women’s Movement and Women’s Education</h2>
<p>Some of the women who planned and carried out the convention at Seneca Falls in the
mid-18th century were recipients of women’s education and felt strongly about the value of
education for women, its promise for equity and the measure of independence offered to women
through education. In that first Declaration of Sentiments read aloud in Seneca Fall in 1848,
these women lamented men’s domination over women and their denial of the opportunities and
facilities for a comprehensive education. They insisted that women be given full access to the
same institutions and educational programs available to men.</p>
