<p>It follows Michael from being a very small child till a late-teen in university (set in London) and him discovering what it is to be gay, but also how to make the label fit him, not he fit the label. Michael is a half-Jamaican, half Greek Cypriot boy growing up in London. He realizes early on that being mixed-race makes him different. He doesn’t feel black enough for the Caribbean Society, or Greek enough for Hellenic Society, or queer enough for the LBGT Society. Then Michael finally finds a fit at Drag Society where he becomes The Black Flamingo, “someone fabulous, wild and strong". </p>

Norris, a 14-year-old Black French Canadian, arrives in Austin, Texas, where his mother (who's divorced from Norris' dad) is starting a job as a linguistics professor. His cultural education on U.S. high schools comes from watching his mom's video collection of TV shows and movies from the 1980s and 1990s. His mom has promised they'll go back to Montreal if the transition doesn't work for him -- but he must try. He keeps a notebook of the habits of his schoolmates and teachers as if they were the subjects of an anthropology field study. Soon, despite himself, Norris adjusts to U.S. teen life. He gets a fast food job, makes friends, and pursues romantic interests. His life gets complicated when two different girls become rivals for his attention.
