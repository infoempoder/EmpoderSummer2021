But things change when he learns that his cousin Jun, his childhood best friend and pen pal, died as a victim of President Duterte's war on drugs. His family hasn't provided many details about Jun's death and refuses to talk about him. Jay can't believe that his cousin would get involved with drugs, so he decides to spend spring break in the Philippines to discover the truth. As family secrets are slowly revealed, Jay learns more about himself, his family, and the side of Jun he never knew.    </p>

  <p> Darius Kellner speaks better Klingon than Farsi, and he knows more about Hobbit social cues than Persian ones. He's about to take his first-ever trip to Iran, and it's pretty overwhelmingâ€”especially when he's also dealing with clinical depression, a disapproving dad, and a chronically anemic social life. In Iran, he gets to know his ailing but still formidable grandfather, his loving grandmother, and the rest of his mom's family for the first time. And he meets Sohrab, the boy next door who changes everything. When it's time to go home to America, he'll have to find a way to be Darioush on his own.
