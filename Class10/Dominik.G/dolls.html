  <h1>This is what me and my cousins like to do!</h1>
   <li>When Im with my cousin that is 1 year younger we either play roblox..watch a movie or she does my nails!</li>

   <li>If Im with my older cousin then we either talk about stuff or play roblox and listen to music</li>

   <li>When Im with my youger cousins then I would play tag or play dress up with them and sometimes play dolls too</li>

    <h1>I love playing with my cousins because I don't see them very often only my cousin that is 1 year younger,I see her every weekend! I like spending time with my other cousins when I get the chance too.</h1>
