	 <h3> We 'develop' or in a simpler word we 'grow'. Technology grows and advances. Fahison grows. Beauty advances. Even us as humans advance and grow. And while that is beautiful its also harmful in a few ways. Lets talk about Fashion. When washing some types of wardrobe, they can send thousands of plastic bits into the ocean! And so many animals get skinned alive to be used as textiles. The fashion industry is the <mark> second largest consumer in water supply!!!</mark>another big problem is that more than 85% of all of the clothes that is worn and produced goes to the dump each year. Thats wasting a huge amount of supplies!</h3>

  <h3> Beauty. Beauty has become a huge part of society. From the way of how someone looks like to how to be "pretty." And makeup is a huge part of that! So we all know about animal testing, right? you may think animals testing is doing a makeup look on them to see if it might cause a reaction but its not. well i suppose it is but its not that "friendly." </h3>
    
    <h3> The actual meaning of animals testing, is were a <mark> Live animal</mark> is forced to to do a scientific experiment that is sure to cause them a lot of pain and suffering. the worst part is that they get killed at the end of an experiment.<mark> More than 110 million animals get killed in U.S. laboratories every year. </mark> Saddest part is that <mark>only 3% percent of animals survive lab experiments.</mark>  </h3>

  <h3> continuing to talk about animlas getting used for experiments, you wouldn't belive that they also get used for medical training. this is still very hurtful but until we can find other ways  to practice medicine i guess we just need to live with that. </h3> 
  <h3> fun fact: "What cosmetics tests are performed on animals? Although <mark>they are not required by law</mark>, several invasive tests are performed on rabbits, mice, guinea pigs and rats. ... Skin and eye irritation tests where <mark>chemicals are rubbed onto the shaved skin or dripped into the eyes of restrained rabbits</mark>, without any pain relief."</h3>
