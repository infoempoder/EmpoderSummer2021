For example recycling saves energy, reduces landfills,  and prevents pollution by reducing the need to collect new raw materials. Recycling does not only help with that but also helps with much more!

      <h4>Energy</h4>
        <p class="smallTextt">Recycling helps save energy by dcreasing the need to make materials from natural resources. Making new products requires  alot of energy as well as be really expensive. So instead of people having to collect natrual recources, people  can make the same products with less energy usage. Since recycled materials have already been refined and proccesed once.  Lastly saving energy helps our enviroment by  reducing pollution.   </p> <br>

      <h4>Landfill</h4>
      <p class="smallTextt">One of the great benefits recycling does is that it reduces waste in landfills. Recycling reduces landfills by  reusing old materials like plastic, aluminium, paper, and glass to make new things. Since this is an going process from making old materials to new ones,  it does not pile up waste in landfills. It is good when there is not that much waste in landfills because overfilled landfills carry toxic chemicals from the waste that end up in our water supply. An overfilled  landfill can also carry harmfull gasses that can cause health proplems.</p> <br>

      <h4>Pollution</h4>
      <p class="smallTextt"> Recycling is a great help for preventing both air and water pollution. This is connected to my reasoning on how recycling saves energy because  recycling reduces pollution by less energy being used. And normally energy is used to  collect new raw meterials, but recycling helps when old used materials can turn into new materials. This is great because the process saves energy, and reduces pollution . And if you dont know already pollution can be harmful to our enviroment like trees, crops, animals, water, and people. So it is great when pollution is being reduced .    </p> <br>
