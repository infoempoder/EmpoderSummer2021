   <h1 class="center pinkBackground"> Racism Within the NBA/WNBA </h1> 
   
   <br> 

   <p class="pinkBackground"> On this webpage we will touch on the subject of racism within the NBA/WNBA. As some people don't like to admit racism is well and alive in our society and is not seen as an issue bye some people which is sad becuase of the big effect it has on POC. But even within POC a lot of racism is showed. A lot of people when they think of a black person who gets money is either in the streets, scamming or plays a profession which is sad. They don't see us as people who can me enterpernuers or people who work in STEM. and we need to change that as a whole. </p> 

   <br> 

   <p class="pinkBackground"> I will show just a couple pictures and videos because it is so sad how many people would skip past whats going on just because the issue doesn't effect them but could be an issue to someone they know.</p>

   <p class="pinkBackground"> The first image I showed was when fans were saying that the clippers coach needed to be changed because it was very clear tht he was very racist and I believe he had made some racist remarks again. This has been an ongoing cycle even from back in the 60's and before then. Next I put that video because it shows the top ten most racist moments showed or noticed and at that what they felt like putting in the video. Again like I have said A lot it is so sad to see but sadly this is the society we live in that needs to change. </p> 

   <p class="pinkBackground"> although there is a lot I havent shared that goes on, I Very lightly showed some issues. The next webpage will talk about sexism press that in the navbar to read about that :)</p>
