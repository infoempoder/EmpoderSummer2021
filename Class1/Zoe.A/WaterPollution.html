    <p>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances often chemicals or micro-organisms contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or anything with water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment. Many beaches are very polluted and trashed. In certain places water was not drinkable and that is an issue because we need water to live but also all of this pullution is not only harming us, but it's harming sea animals. Some sea animals eat all of that trash and end up dying so some are now going extinct. Water pollution can be unsfae water which can kill people. If you didnt have a water filter the you could possibly be drinking lead and other harmful chemicals.</p>

    <p>Many openings lead to the ocean. You many see little holes on the streets that have fish by it and that means that anything that goes down that drain goes to the ocean. Many things can go down there or people may pour or throw stuff down there which makes animals die. Parts of the water could be contaminated and will makes animals gety sick and if it keeps happening to that type then they will go extinct. So do your part by not littering and following the rules! </p>
