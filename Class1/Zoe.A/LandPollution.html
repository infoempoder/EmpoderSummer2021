<p> Pollution is everywhere! This is a picture of mount everest, one of the tallest mountains in the world. There is so much trash out there and that isnt safe. Animals can eat it and dies and fom there it can fly into other places. So many cities may look super cool but since the population is so high, there is way more trash which is horrible especially if it is by nature. New York produces almost 2 punds of garbage a day! That is horible becuase all of that garbage could just fly around the city and even fly twords the water which would be even worse!</p>
