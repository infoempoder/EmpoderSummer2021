      <h2 class="leftPadding rightPadding"> Generational Differences</h2> 
      <p3> Child marriages have been a issues for centuries but in today's society there are still child marriages happening all over the world atleast half being in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Nigeria. For girls child marriage can be also more severe as it can implenet not only physical harm but mental as well. 37%  of women in the sub-Saharan Africa were married before the age of 18. Child brides are frequently deprived of basic human rights such as health, education and safety. Girls married young are far less likely to stay in school, with lifelong economic impacts. They are often isolated, with their freedom curtailed. They are at higher risk of physical and sexual violence. Child brides are also at greater risk of experiencing dangerous complications in pregnancy and childbirth, contracting HIV/AIDS and suffering domestic violence. Along so the "role" of a women in these families are seen to be no more than to cook, clean and to have a family very young. Getting these girls educated would teach them that there are places for them other than being in a kitchen or having a child at the age of 14.  </p3>

      <h2 class="leftPadding rightPadding"> Poverty </h2> 
      <p3 class="leftPadding rightPadding"> Families living in poverty often have to choose between sending their child to school or providing other basic needs. Even if families do not have to pay tuition fees, school comes with the added costs of uniforms, books, supplies, and/or exam fees. Some children are forced to stay at home doing chores or need to work. In other places, especially in crisis and conflict areas with destroyed infrastructure and limited resources, unaffordable private schools are sometimes the only option. In many of these situations it is near impposible for girls to gain financial indipendence. Education can be a solution to most of these issus because it can promote economic growth by providing skills that increase employment opportunities and income. Nearly 60 million people could escape poverty if all adults had just two more years of schooling, and 420 million people could be lifted out of poverty if all adults completed secondary education, according to UNESCO.</p3>

  <h2> Universal Basic Income (UBI) </h2> 
  <p3>  You might be wondering well if families were to send their kids to school what about them? How could they still put food on the table without that source of income? UBI could be a possible solution that ties both problems and more. UBI is Goverment guaranteed payment that each citizen recieves. Its purpose is to cover the basic cost of living and to establish finnancial security for everyone no matter if you have a job or not. Although there could be some negatives to this solution there could also be many positives. If families had enough money to sustain their basic needs they may be more open to allowing their kids to finish school or just not putting them in a bad situation. A study done in Kenya of 63 villages showed that with nine transfers of money totalling 45$ a month imporoved local consuption and well being. </p3>
