    <p class="center "> The environment is important because if it gets desroyed we would not be able to live in it like right now there is climate change happening, the forest are getting on fire, we are having drought, the Artics are getting destroyed becuase of how warm the earth is getting, also there are a lot of polution happening and the Oceans are also getting destroyed because there is no more space to put the trash so it goes into the Ocean. </p>


    <p class="center"> The Environment is So IMPORTANT to us so we have to work hard to try and keep it CLEAN from polution, saving water when there are droughts, using less energy try too cosumeless of everything.Also we have to protect the forest wich are getting burned by how hot it is, also we should protect our wildlfe because most animals are getting extinted. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE PAST, BUT WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE BY HELPING KEEP CLEAN THE EARTH SO IT WILL LAST FOR OTHER GENERATIONS TO LIVE IN. </p>
