  <div class = "column4"> <p> The movement was a fight for determination for women to demad their rights, to be equal as men. Not just voting rights but control of their own decisions and bodies. Women aquired not just the right to vote but equality and privilages, which led to woman being able to get custody of their own children after divorce, higher  salaries, to get a good education, to serve in the government and to have their right to own property. In conclusion after 72 years of dedication the 19th Amendment was certified on August 20 1920. </p></div>
